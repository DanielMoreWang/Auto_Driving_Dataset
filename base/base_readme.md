We place some base knowledge for our data collection system from hardware perspective and software perspective.
Under the sensors subdictionary, we place general background for RGB camera, thermal camera, LiDAR, and Depth camera, including imaging principle, data, and calibration.
In the docker.ipynb, we give a little knowlege for docker:
    What is docker?
    what docker use for?
    How docker work?
    How to use docker?
    What to attention when using docker?
In the ros.ipynb, we give a little knowlege for ros:
    What is ros?
    what ros use for?
    How ros work?
    How to use ros?
    What to attention when using ros?
In the opencv.ipynb, we give a little knowlege for opencv:
    What is opencv?
    what opencvs use for?
    How opencv work?
    How to use opencv?
    What to attention when using opencv?
